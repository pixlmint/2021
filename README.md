# My 2021 Journal

In 2018 I had a little blog during my 3 Weeks in Paris where I documented my time there. Looking back at that I get very sentimental and I figured, since I'm not someone to have a book journal, I would much rather do something like that with my own Website. So here we are. Feel free to check in every now and then, under [https://2021.christian-groeber.ch](2021.christian-groeber.ch).
